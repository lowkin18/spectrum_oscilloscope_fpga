2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock spectrum_feb10_xadc_hdmi_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_fpga_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_hdmi_test1_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_hdmi_test1_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_hdmi_test1_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_hdmi_test1_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.455 ns between spectrum_feb10_xadc_hdmi_i/hdmi_full_gen_1_0/inst/hdmi_full_gen_1_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/screen_data_reg_128_191_6_8/RAMB/CLK (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and spectrum_feb10_xadc_hdmi_i/hdmi_full_gen_1_0/inst/hdmi_full_gen_1_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/redHold__reg[7]/D (clocked by clk_out1_hdmi_test1_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.480 ns between spectrum_feb10_xadc_hdmi_i/hdmi_full_gen_1_0/inst/hdmi_full_gen_1_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/screen_data_reg_128_191_6_8/RAMB/CLK (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and spectrum_feb10_xadc_hdmi_i/hdmi_full_gen_1_0/inst/hdmi_full_gen_1_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/blueHold__reg[7]/D (clocked by clk_out1_hdmi_test1_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.507 ns between spectrum_feb10_xadc_hdmi_i/hdmi_full_gen_1_0/inst/hdmi_full_gen_1_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/screen_data_reg_128_191_6_8/RAMB/CLK (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and spectrum_feb10_xadc_hdmi_i/hdmi_full_gen_1_0/inst/hdmi_full_gen_1_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/redHold__reg[5]/D (clocked by clk_out1_hdmi_test1_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.515 ns between spectrum_feb10_xadc_hdmi_i/hdmi_full_gen_1_0/inst/hdmi_full_gen_1_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/screen_data_reg_128_191_6_8/RAMB/CLK (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and spectrum_feb10_xadc_hdmi_i/hdmi_full_gen_1_0/inst/hdmi_full_gen_1_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/greenHold__reg[7]/D (clocked by clk_out1_hdmi_test1_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#5 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.766 ns between spectrum_feb10_xadc_hdmi_i/hdmi_full_gen_1_0/inst/hdmi_full_gen_1_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/screen_data_reg_128_191_6_8/RAMB/CLK (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and spectrum_feb10_xadc_hdmi_i/hdmi_full_gen_1_0/inst/hdmi_full_gen_1_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/blueHold__reg[4]/D (clocked by clk_out1_hdmi_test1_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock spectrum_feb10_xadc_hdmi_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin spectrum_feb10_xadc_hdmi_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-through : [get_pins -filter {NAME =~ *SyncAsync*/oSyncStages_reg[0]/D} -hier]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '4' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
